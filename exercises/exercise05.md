* [Task 1: Create the invoice storage container](#task-1-create-the-invoice-storage-container)
* [Task 2: Create and train an Azure Forms Recognizer model and setup Cognitive Search](#task-2-create-and-train-an-azure-forms-recognizer-model-and-setup-cognitive-search)
* [Task 3: Configure a skillset with Form Recognizer](#task-3-configure-a-skillset-with-form-recognizer)
* [Task 4: Create the Synapse Pipeline](#task-4-create-the-synapse-pipeline)

In this exercise you will create a Synapse Pipeline that will orchestrate updating the part prices from a supplier invoice. You will accomplish this by a combination of a Synapse Pipeline with an Azure Cognitive Search Skillset that invokes the Form Recognizer service as a custom skill. The pipeline will work as follows:

- Invoice is uploaded to Azure Storage.
- An Azure Cognitive Search index is started
- The index of any new or updated invoices invokes an Azure Cognitive Search skillset.
- The first skill in the skillset invokes an Azure Function, passing it the URL to the PDF invoice.
- The Azure Function invokes the Form Recognizer service, passing it the URL and SAS token to the PDF invoice. Forms recognizer returns the OCR results to the function.
- The Azure Function returns the results to skillset. The skillset then extracts only the product names and costs and sends that to a configure knowledge store that writes the extracted data to JSON files in Azure Blob Storage.
- The Synapse pipeline reads these JSON files from Azure Storage in a Data Flow activity and performs an upsert against the product catalog table in the Synapse SQL Pool.
